This repo is just a place to store documentation and library functions from [ECE 376 - Embedded Systems](http://www.bisonacademy.com/ECE376/Index.htm) (taught by Dr. Jacob Glower) so that I don't forget it.

## Dependencies

In order to build this project you need a few tools.

[MPLABX](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide)
[HI-TECH C](http://www.bisonacademy.com/Software/HCPIC18-pro-9.63PL3.zip)
[PIC Flash Tool](http://www.bisonacademy.com/Software/PIC_Flash_Tool_1.2.exe)

These tools can all be found on [BisonAcademy](http://www.bisonacademy.com/ECE376/Resources.htm)

## Documentation

Doxygen style comments are used to create documentation for the helper functions in `lib/`. To generate html and latex docs, [install Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) (and add the Doxygen bin directory to the PATH) and run `doxygen` in the terminal to generate docs in `docs/`.
